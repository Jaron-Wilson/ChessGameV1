/**
 * <p>Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game.
 * The purpose of FEN is to provide all the necessary information to restart a game from a particular position.</p>
 *
 * <p>FEN is based on a system developed by Scottish newspaper journalist David Forsyth. Forsyth's system became popular
 * in the 19th century; Steven J. Edwards extended it to support use by computers. FEN is defined[2] in the
 * "Portable Game Notation Specification and Implementation Guide".[1] In the Portable Game Notation for chess games,
 * FEN is used to define initial positions other than the standard one.[3] FEN does not provide sufficient
 * information to decide whether a draw by threefold repetition may be legally claimed or a draw offer may be
 * accepted; for that, a different format such as Extended Position Description is needed.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A FEN "record" defines a particular game position, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set.
 * A text file with only FEN data records should have the file extension ".fen".
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A FEN record contains six fields. The separator between fields is a space. The fields are:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>Piece placement</b> (from White's perspective). Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with
 *         rank 1; within each rank, the contents of each square are described from file "a" through file "h".
 *         Following the Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), each piece is identified by a single letter taken from
 *         the standard English names (pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and king = "K").
 *         White pieces are designated using upper-case letters ("PNBRQK") while black pieces use lowercase ("pnbrqk").
 *         Empty squares are noted using digits 1 through 8 (the number of empty squares), and "/" separates ranks.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>Active color</b>. "w" means White moves next, "b" means Black moves next.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>Castling availability</b>. If neither side can castle, this is "-". Otherwise, this has one or more
 *         letters: "K" (White can castle kingside), "Q" (White can castle queenside), "k" (Black can castle kingside),
 *         and/or "q" (Black can castle queenside). A move that temporarily prevents castling does not negate this
 *         notation.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>En passant</b> target square in algebraic notation. If there's no en passant target square, this is "-".
 *         If a pawn has just made a two-square move, this is the position "behind" the pawn. This is recorded
 *         regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to make an en passant capture.[6]
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>Halfmove clock: </b>The number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance, used for the fifty-move rule.[7]
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>Fullmove number:</b> The number of the full move. It starts at 1, and is incremented after Black's move.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
